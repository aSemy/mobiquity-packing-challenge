# mobiquity-packing-challenge

## Introduction 

Coding challenge as part of an interview process. A parcel 

The computer science problem is the '0/1 knapsack problem'. Parsing and validation of input data is also required.

## Running

Main class is [Packer.java](https://github.com/aSemy/mobiquity-packing-challenge/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mobiquityinc/packer/Packer.java). The method `pack(filepath)` can be called to process a file. This must be passed the location of a file with valid data.

Data must be formatted so that each line is an independent problem to be solved. The expected encoding is UTF-8.

The data must be in the correct format, with exact spacing

Format: `<parcel weight (positive rational number)> : (<item index (positive integer)>,<item weight (positive rational number),â‚¬<item cost in Euros (positive rational number)>)`

There can be up to 15 items.

### Tests

Unit tests can be run with `mvn test`

### Install

To use in other projects (locally), run `mvn clean install`, then add this project as a dependency.

```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.mobiquityinc</groupId>
      <artifactId>mobiquity-package-challenge</artifactId>
      <version>1.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

### Errors

Exceptions should be wrapped in an APIException. Even if only one line has an error, no response will be returned for other valid lines.

### Notes

Packet has been renamed to Parcel throughout the code, as Packet is a restricted Java keyword so it makes it a big nicer to code with something unrestricted.

In the example where no solution was possible, the character `-` was returned, so that will always be the case for no solution.

### TODO 

Change the price to be any currency, not just Euros
